NetHack 3.4.3, NAO version, for OSX
===

This repository contains a fork of the [nethack.alt.org](http://nethack.alt.org) repository altered for OSX installation.

Automated installation
---
The purpose of this repository is to allow a more playable (i.e. heavily patched, but not in a play-altering way) version of Nethack to be easily installed via the Homebrew package manager. Tap my repository of formulae with

```
% brew tap ffleming/formulae
```
and then install nethack with
```
% brew install nethack-nao
```
